Hello @everyone! the code which I had sent you before was correct but not perfect. Like instead of entering a number if a user enters a character as a choice it would still accept it and instead of giving an error, it would display that “Addition of entered two numbers is 0”, so now I have Added validation in the program so now it is going to accept only a number/ integer as a choice. But still, if a user enters a character it will display “Invalid choice, please enter a valid option” and will display all the options again. Before if a user was entering a number greater than 5 it was displaying “Invalid choices” and was ending the program, so now if a user enters a number greater than 5 it will display “Invalid choice” and will display all the options again, I have done this via using the do-while loop.
